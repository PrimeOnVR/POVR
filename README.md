### Welcome to POVR!
The POVR Menu is a developer menu made to allow rec room circuiteers to test their circuits without being right next to them, with no item needing to be held. This menu is customizable, and can be used for many different things for existing games, like moderation, stats, and much more. The POVR menu has extended functionality, which can auto calibrate its opening gesture without you even knowing that its being calibrated.

### But how does it work?
It works using advanced T-Pose technology, which can constantly auto-calibrate based on your height. Once you T-Pose, a menu will appear in your watch asking you what you want to do.
