# POVR Menu

### Welcome to POVR!
The POVR Menu is a developer menu made to allow rec room circuiteers to test their circuits without being right next to them, with no item needing to be held. This menu is customizable, and can be used for many different things for existing games, like moderation, stats, and much more. The POVR menu has extended functionality, which has multiple ways to open it, with different versions for your needs

### But how does it work?
It works using advanced facepalm technology, which can allow you to open the menu easily with little false positives. With our newest version, POVR Blend, we take it to the next level, with the most advanced technology yet and a system that works on screenmodes and VR players, and calibration no longer being required.
